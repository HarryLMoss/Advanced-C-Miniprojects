# Advanced C Miniprojects
An extension from the previous repository 'C Programming Miniprojects' built in VSCode, which explores more advanced concepts and techniques available in the C programming language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Install `gcc` or `clang`.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the latest version from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **C/C++ Extension**: Install the C/C++ extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarryLMoss/Advanced-C-Miniprojects.git
   cd Advanced-C-Miniprojects
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have gcc or clang installed. You can install them with the following commands:
   For Ubuntu/Debian:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```
   For MacOS:
    ```bash
    brew install gcc
    ```
   For Windows:
   Download MinGW or Cygwin and install gcc.

3. **Open the Project in VS Code**:
   Open Visual Studio Code.
   Click on File > Open Folder... and select the project folder.
   Visual Studio Code should automatically detect the C/C++ files.

4. **Build the Project**:
   Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (View > Terminal or `Ctrl + ``).
   Use the following command to build the project:
    ```bash
    gcc -o main main.c
    ```
   Replace main and main.c with your desired output file name and source file name(s).

6. **Run the Project**:
   Execute the compiled binary with:
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```
   Adjust the command based on your output file name and operating system.
